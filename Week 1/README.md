# Week 1 - Foundations of NLP

## Concepts


What is NLP? Tokens, types, corpora

Text preprocessing:

tokenization

stemming vs lemmatization

stopword removal

n-grams

Basic ML for NLP (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF)

Evaluation metrics: accuracy, F1, BLEU (overview)

Coding Tasks

Implement tokenization & stemming using Python + NLTK / spaCy

Build a TF-IDF text classifier for sentiment (IMDb or SST-2)
